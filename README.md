== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why does it flag something as bad? =

It's not flagging "bad" things, as such. The theme check is designed to be a non-perfect way to test for compliance with the [Theme Review](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Review) and CampusPress guidelines. Not all themes must adhere to these guidelines. The purpose of the checking tool is to ensure that themes uploaded to CampusPress meet the latest standards of WordPress themes and will work on a wide variety of sites.

This theme checker is not perfect, and never will be. It is only a tool to help theme authors, or anybody else who wants to make their theme more capable. All themes submitted to CampusPress are hand-reviewed by a team of experts. The automated theme checker is meant to be a useful tool only, not an absolute system of measurement.
